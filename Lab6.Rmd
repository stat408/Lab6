Turn in one copy for each group. If group members are not present in class they will be required to complete their own lab to receive credit. Please turn in **both a DOC or PDF file and your R Markdown script**. 

## Lab Overview
This lab is extremly open ended. You are should create at least two informative figures using the OkCupid dataset (at least one of which needs to be created using `ggplot2`). Note OkCupid dataset in an anonymized version of dating profiles for OkCupid members in the San Francisco area.

This may require some data manipulation / wrangling to create variables and in turn interesting figures.


```{r}
library(readr)
okcupid <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/OKCupid_profiles_clean.csv")
```
